# FertilityStudy
This is a master thesis project done by Ezgi Günbatar for Applied Data Science program at Utrecht University. The repository contains datasets and codebooks which are used in "The Role of Social Networks and Personal Characteristics in Shaping Fertility Intentions: A Multi-Method Machine Learning Perspective" study.

The study aims to find an answer to the “Do the individual characteristics and the social network attributes affect women’s desire to have children?” question. For this purpose, individual and network characteristics are used for predicting the having children intentions.

In this context, methods such as Graph Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine were used for predicting fertility intentions.
